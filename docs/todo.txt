To DO:
    - Add instructions (including loads of useful maths functions, bitwise functions)
    - Create a MidasVM compiler struct and language to convert source code into a serialised MyCode object.
        - Allow labels to be any string (except numbers)
        - Deduce instruction type from operand.
        - Use basic notation to indicate constants, literals, etc.

To think about:
    - Implement Pause, Play and Stop functionality within Participants
    - Think of a way to handle data sent from participant to host.
        - Where should it be saved on the computer?
        - How should it be serialised?
