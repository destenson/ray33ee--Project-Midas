Version 0.1.4
    - Logical numbering of opcodes grouping similar instructions together and leaving gaps for future codes
    - Now we use SocketAddrV4 to validate IP addresses (with port number)
    - Added hash map for constants (to be used by compiler)
    - Added conversion from Operand to f64 (for use in f64 functions)
    - Sample source code for MidasVM has now been added to outline what source code will look like

Version 0.1.3
    - Simple address command line option for both host and participant
    - We now work with Vec<Operand> instead of two different vectors
    - When the MidasVM finishes, it sends what's left of its stack to the host
    - Added a bunch of useful constants from std::f64::consts
    - We now have a way to transfer data to participant independent of the Code. We do this by moving the data on to a list of local variables addressed from 'd_0'
    - Added more mov functions (movdl, movds, movdv and movc)
    - Constants declared in instructions.rs
    - Copy trait added to Operand, cleared various borrow-check warnings

Version 0.1.2
    - Can now send code from host to participant
    - Modified code in Host and Participant structs to setup in new() and check in check_events
    - Participant and Host now check network for the various types of messages outlined in Message enum
    - Cleared various warnings
    - -mode argument now validated with possible_values function instead of custom validator
    - Participant to Host Vectors now include an i64, used to identify if needed

Version 0.1.1
    - Added very simple client-server network connection
    - Added various modules for network host, participant, common code(messages.rs) and compiler option
    - StackVM code is now serializable
    - Host or participant mode now selected via command line arg

Version 0.1.0
