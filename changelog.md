# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).


## [Unreleased]
### To Do
- Add instructions (including loads of useful maths functions, bitwise functions)
- Create a MidasVM compiler struct and language to convert source code into a serialised MyCode object.
  - Deduce instruction type from operand.
  - Make sure all bytecode is appended with the 'stop' label
- Add readme for project and modify stack_vm readme to outline changes
- Find a way dynamically generate certain repetitive code based on xml or json. Candidates include:
  - List of instructions (created in get_instructions)
  - List of pre-defined constants (created in get_constants)
  - Pre-defined constant map (created in get_constants_map)
- Modify float_reg to allow lack of leading zero, such as '.3' and exponents such as '0.3e4' still making sure we do not allow integers
- Implement error handling for compiler.rs (go over unpack and expect first)
- Find a better way to pass Regexes around
- Make sure the constants table we generate doesn't conflict with the predefined constants

### Unfinished Ideas
- Think of a way to handle data sent from participant to host.
  - Where should it be saved on the computer?
  - How should it be serialised?

## [0.1.6] - 2021-02-15
### Added
- Added functionality to enable play, pause and stopping of the VM
- Better changelog created
- Bulk of the work for compiler is complete
  - Enums for statements, tokens, etc.
  - Conversion from string into enums
  - Thinking behind strategy documented in compiler.rs
  - Regexes added for matching
  - Extensive use of regex and slice pattern matching

### Fixed
- \_d functions now use Machine::heap field instead of local variables

## [0.1.5] - 2021-02-15
### Added
- We now automatically pull the version number from Cargo.toml for use in clap
- stack_vm now modified into iterator that allows us to step instructions
- stack_vm modified to allow a heap
- New stack_vm added to github, can be found [here](https://github.com/ray33ee/stack-vm)
- Participant now contains the machine as a field
- Each call of check_events will call Machine::next() if the machine is loaded
- Stepping over machine prevents the blocking affect of Machine::run
- Participant::check_events now uses EventQueue::receive_timeout so we can execute in within main loop

## [0.1.4] - 2021-02-14
### Added
- Logical numbering of opcodes grouping similar instructions together and leaving gaps for future codes
- Added hash map for constants (to be used by compiler)
- Added conversion from Operand to f64 (for use in f64 functions)
- Sample source code for MidasVM has now been added to outline what source code will look like

### Fixed
- Now we use SocketAddrV4 to validate IP addresses (with port number)

## [0.1.3] - 2021-02-13
### Added
- Simple address command line option for both host and participant
- We now work with Vec<Operand> instead of two different vectors
- When the MidasVM finishes, it sends what's left of its stack to the host
- Added a bunch of useful constants from std::f64::consts
- We now have a way to transfer data to participant independent of the Code. We do this by moving the data on to a list of local variables addressed from 'd_0'
- Added more mov functions (movdl, movds, movdv and movc)
- Constants declared in instructions.rs

### Fixed
- Copy trait added to Operand, cleared various borrow-check warnings

## [0.1.2] - 2021-02-12
### Added
- Can now send code from host to participant
- Modified code in Host and Participant structs to setup in new() and check in check_events
- Participant and Host now check network for the various types of messages outlined in Message enum
- Cleared various warnings
- -mode argument now validated with possible_values function instead of custom validator
- Participant to Host Vectors now include an i64, used to identify if needed

## [0.1.1] - 2021-02-11
### Added
- Added very simple client-server network connection
- Added various modules for network host, participant, common code(messages.rs) and compiler option
- StackVM code is now serializable
- Host or participant mode now selected via command line arg

## [0.1.0] - 2021-02-10
### Added
- Initial commit
